# pandas-challenge

This respository contains the Module 4 Challenge inside of the "PyCitySchools" folder.

I have followed all of the directions from the grading rubric and have gotten the correct output per the template provided.

The assignment also asked for two correct conclusions from the data for Pyschools. Please see my answers below:
  (1) From looking at the "Scores by School Type" dataframe, Charter schools perform better than District schools across every field. This is also highlighted by the fact the top 5 performing schools are all charter schools and the bottom 5 performing schools are district schools.
  
  (2) From looking at the "Scores by School Size" dataframe, smaller schools are performing slightly better than schools with more students. This could be because smaller schools allow faculty to pay more attention to individual students.
  
  If you have any additional questions, please reach out.
